# Anti-Ai-Detector
Aad is a tool I created for fun to bypass AI detection algorithms.

## How?

- The Tool is Adding non-printable characters after each letter, which is a simple technique in an attempt to bypass AI detection systems.
- By inserting these non-printable characters after each letter in an AI-generated text, the resulting text appears visually unchanged to the human eye. However, the underlying character sequence is modified, potentially making it harder for AI detection algorithms to recognize the patterns associated with AI-generated content.
